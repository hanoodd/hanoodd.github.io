# Crab-Man

The project is a movie premiere website for my film. There is an overall concept of crabs that links to my film concept. I wanted the user to feel immersed in the fake 'Barvel' Studios movie production company I made by adding elements that would make the website seem credible.

I implemented the concept of crabs by including a large crab vector as the play button for the trailer. I also changed the background colors to different shades of blue to portray the ocean. I made the website seem credible with adding 5 star reviews, movie posters of previous works, and a preorder ticket button. To include some Java, I added a hamburger menu that shows up when the website browser size has been reduced.

My website met most of my expectations and goals that were outlined on my wireframe. I was able to complete the image carousel for my home website and created all the other pages. I am really happy with the end result and only had to make some minor changes. For example, the reviews section was going to be a slider however the coding labels were too similar to the first image carousel so I compromised, instead the reviews are all laid out.
